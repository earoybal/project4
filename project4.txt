Practical Project 4.

Purpose:

The script seqcheck.sh will check that DNA sequence data in a text file in bpp/phylip format is correctly specified. The format is made up of multiple gene/locus entries, each with the following format:

no_sequences no_sites

sequence_1_name   DNA bases...
sequence_2_name   DNA bases...
.
.
sequence_n_name   DNA bases...

where n=no_sequences

Specifically, the script should check that the number of sequences at each locus matches the header no_sequences and that the number of sites in each sequence matches the header no_sites at each locus. The script should print a summary to stdout of the results, for example:

Locus 1: no_seqs 24 matched observed. no_sites: 453 matched observed.
Locus 2: no_seqs 14 matched observed. no_sites: 536 matched observed.
etc.

If errors are observed in a file print informative messages, for example:
Locus 16: no_seqs 16 did not match observed 17

Use the file bpp-4.6.2/examples/frogs/frogs.txt from the bpp software installed in tutorial 13 to test your script.

Syntax:

The seqcheck.sh script should run with the following command:

./seqcheck.sh seq_data

where seq_data is a sequence data file in bpp/phylip format.

General Features:

Add appropriate error checking to your code (e.g., does the file seq_data exist?, etc) and include informative comments that explain what your code is doing. Create and maintain your code in a public github repository under your account named project4.
