5 loci in the frogs.txt
to get # loci: grep -E '[[:digit:]]+[[:space:]]{1}[[:digit:]]+' | wc -l
idea:
use grep -Vc to get # of loci and use that as # for for loop. Use for loop to separate each loci into separate variable or files depending on which works better once I get it done. Use another for loop to loop through each loci, printing output.
Can use grep -n to get line # for the start of each loci and then use seq # to determine how much to scan.
